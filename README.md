# power_control_files
This is an iterative open source product design. It started as a way to control a coffee pot and
is evolving into a way to control anything. Accordingly, there are files for the starting proto,
proto 3D files to fit a Pi, etc. It evolves to have a custom board spin with schematic, layout,
and proper container. This will contain all firmware and phone apps as well.
